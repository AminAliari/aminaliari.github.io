"Mithra" is a physically-based graphics renderer featuring many new and modern rendering techniques such as image-based lighting, shadow-mapping, etc.
I have also proposed and defended this renderer as my B.Sc. project at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).

This is a showcase of some of its main features. Hopefully, in near future, I will share more about the development process in this blog.‚Äç
