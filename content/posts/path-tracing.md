Any graphics programmer would, at some point, take a look at the fantastic [Ray Tracing in One Weekend book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and get motivated enough to roll out their own version. So...I did the same!
However, mine took a little more than a "weekend" because I decided to implement it on GPU (DirectX 12, Vulkan) and also add features such as physically-based atmospheric scattering. Here are some figures:

# Conclusion
To wrap this up, let's look at an issue I encountered while implementing the path tracer. Yeah, it was the good old `NaN` attacking the poor pixels. ðŸ˜”
You know, we never start with shiny pixels...

# Future Work
- Using Monte Carlo.
- Supporting different BRDF models.
- Supporting triangle intersection.
- Using acceleration structures.
- Use Blue Noise in the random number generator.
