      <description>Photo: The Last of Us Part II  Recently, I explored different Motion Blur techniques being used in the video game industry. Now, I have decided to jot down the result of this research.
At the first glance, I found several per-pixel motion blur approaches, but they did not impress me. To explain why I was not satisfied with the results, some history lessons are required!
Screen-space Motion Blur My main issue with the trivial approaches was that they would only take the camera motion into account.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Mithra&amp;rdquo; is a physically-based graphics renderer featuring many new and modern rendering techniques such as image-based lighting, shadow-mapping, etc. I have also proposed and defended this renderer as my B.Sc. project at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
 This is a showcase of some of its main features. Hopefully, in near future, I will share more about the development process in this blog.‚Äç
